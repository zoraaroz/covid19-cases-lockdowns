## Covid-19: Comparing cases and lockdowns in Berlin and Zurich

by Zora Sch√§rer | June 2021

### Description
I live in Berlin and many of my friends and family live in Zurich. Like the rest of the world, we all felt the impact of Covid-19 in the past year but our experiences were somewhat different. The German and Swiss governments handeled the pandemic quite differently regarding regulations to contain the disease.

This project compares the Covid-19 cases in these two cities. Was the number of cases similar in both locations? When did they differ and when were the synchronous? Furthermore, I put together a data table to document the lockdowns in both cities. I would like to find out, how these regulations affected the Covid-19 cases.
